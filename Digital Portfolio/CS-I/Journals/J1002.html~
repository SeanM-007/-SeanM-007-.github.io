      <h2>Section 1</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model: </h3>
      <p>Gmail and Network printing both require clients such as PCs and servers for the command to run.</p>

      <h2>Section 2</h2>
      <h3> Question 2: It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of t
	same name is important? Why?.</h3>
      <p>Yes this means the Linux file hierarchy is an absolute path allowing them to branch off and have the same name.</p>

     <h2>Section 3</h2>
<h3>Question 3: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?: </h3>
<p>So you have an Idea of where you are creating new directors and how to organize it.</p>

h2>Section 4</h2>
<h3>Question 4: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h3>
<p>They want us to perform the command and get results ourselves instead of just observing.</p>
h2>Section 5</h2>
<h3>Question 5: What happens each time you press the ↑?</h3>
<p>The up arrow goes and chooses the previous commands before this</p>


<h3>Question 6: What happens each time you press the ↓?</h3>
<p>The bottom arrow goes too the previous command the up arrow went past.</p>
<h2>Section 6</h2>
<h3>Question 7:Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
<p> No it wasn't, I believe that the extra arrow messed up the command as it didn't allow for everything else to be sent somewhere else, or it just  created a new file and sent it there </p>
<h2>Section 7</h2>
<h3>Question 8:How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h3>
<p>The tree shows a list of the directory in order, and ls shows the list of previous commands or the files in the directory
</p>

<h3>Question 9: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How? : </h3>
<p>I counted how long it takes by ranging from 1-20 seconds and seeing if my hypothesis is true.</p>



<h2>Section 8</h2>
<h3>Question 10:What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?: </h3>
<p>The pausing of all commands. The sleep command pauses all commands and the number determines how long the sleep command is active </p>
<h3>Question 11: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How? : </h3>
<p>I counted how long it takes by ranging from 1-20 seconds and seeing if my hypothesis is true.</p>




<h2>Section 9</h2>
<h3>Question 12: How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h3>
<p>The behavior displays a sequence of numbers and does some task that is not noticeable at first glance on the screen.</p>

<h3>Question 13: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?:</h3>
<p>It means to run a program/command while the program is running. Like when you download a game while playing another game is a great example of this.</p>


<h2>Section 10</h2>
<h3>Question 14: What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?: </h3>
<p>A list appears saying stopped and running letting me know if the commands are still running or not</p>
<h3>Question 15: How do you explain your observations?: </h3>
<p>My observation is what appeared on the screen presents a list of the sleep command recently input, and a list if they're currently stopped running or done </p>
